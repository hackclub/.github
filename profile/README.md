## :wave: Hey, welcome to Hack Club 

![bY7tzHej](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39828164/189497810-6d9d2920-6bee-4990-9553-57699918ae9c.jpg)

Welcome to the worldwide community of high school hackers. We‚Äôre artists, writers, engineers, tinkerers, campers, filmmakers and volunteers. We **make** things. We **help** one another. Together, we bring our ideas to life and find joy in what we do. We have **fun**. **[Join us ‚ûö](https://hackclub.com/slack)**

Transparency is a core value of Hack Club, and code is not the only thing we open source. [We've open sourced our finances, workshops, events and more](https://hackclub.com/opensource).
